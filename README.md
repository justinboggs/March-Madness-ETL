## Project Description/Outline: 
Using data from the last five years of NCAA Basketball Tournament results, we will combine multiple datasets to build a database of 2015-2019 results including seed, conference, and regional data. With this database, we would be able for predictive analysis to determine the chance of success for a team based on their conference and tournament seeding. 

## Research Questions to Answer
